            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What types of games do you playtest?</h3>
                <p>I have experience testing a wide range of board games, from simple family-style games to heavy euros. I also playtest video games across various genres. <br> <br> I feel confident that I can provide valuable feedback no matter the genre or stage of development you are in. <br><br> If you're ever unsure if we're a good fit, just send me an email and I can clarify how your specific game would fit into my playtesting process.</p>

                <h3>What is your turnaround time?</h3>
                <p>My turnaround time depends on my schedule and health, but typically you can expect results <b>within 2-3 days</b> of placing your order.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How much of my game will you playtest?</h3>
                <p>If it's not the premium package (and most games don't need that), the honest answer is that I never know. <br> <br> I shoot for a one hour video for each test, but I will always keep testing until I am satisfied that I have thoroughly acquainted myself with the experience the game provides to the player. </p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I send you my game?</h3>
                <p>For <b>boardgames</b>, I usually test on digital platforms like <b>Tabletop Simulator</b> or <b>Screentop.gg</b> (message me if you're using a different platform; I can usually make it work.). <b>Print and Plays</b> I assemble myself, and I'm open to recieving <b>physical prototypes</b> in the mail if that is perferable for you. <br><br>For <b>video games</b>, you can provide access via a download link or a Steam key.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What will I receive in the final report?</h3>
                <p>The final report is a comprehensive document detailing my findings. <br> <br> 
                    While it varies from game to game, it tends to be about three pages in length, and I discuss everything from your vision, theme, the clarity of the rulebook, the game's strengths, considerations and possible areas for improvement (majority of time spent here), spitball ideas to inspire new thinking in an old context, and whatever else I feel is appropriate.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What are your favorite games?</h3>
                <p>I enjoy games of all stripes, but I tend to lean toward the heavier, more complex options. <br> <br> For board games, some of my favorites are Mage Knight, Great Western Trail, Ark Nova, and A Feast For Odin. <br> <br> For video games, I have spent way too much time with autobattlers (particularly Hearthstone: Battlegrounds), Darkest Dungeon, Path of Exile, 7 Days to Die, Heroes of Might and Magic III, and pvp'ing in the original Guild Wars.</p>
