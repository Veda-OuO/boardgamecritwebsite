                    <p>"I think Greg is my new favorite person. Just days after reaching out to him, he sent me a video of a full blind playtest session with my game. He was patient, attentive, insightful, and encouraging. I really can't thank him enough and would encourage any aspiring designer to take advantage of this opportunity!."</p>

                    <p>"Many playtesters tend to be either too negative, which can feel discouraging, or too kind, offering mostly positive impressions that make it harder to identify what needs improvement. You managed to be both encouraging and constructively critical."</p>

                    <p>"For an indie designer like me, this kind of in-depth, constructive feedback is pure gold. It's not just a list of problems, but a clear analysis that provides motivation and a real direction for improvement. It's clear that he does this out of a genuine passion for helping the design community."</p>

                    <h3>Uncover The Experience</h3>
                    <p>My primary role as a playtester is to uncover the unique experience your game offers to its players. <br> <br> Does it deliver on the vision you have in mind as the designer?<br><br>What already succeeds and is fun? What could be improved?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card card-truth">
                    <h3>Find What Is True</h3>
                    <p>It is my belief that there are truths within the creative world: some games just are more fun than others.<br> <br> Players can feel when a game needed more time in the tank.<br> <br> My ambition is to help you discover these truths within your own project so that your next step can be taken with confidence and purpose.</p>

                    <h3>Art = Hard</h3>
                    <p>While my first duty is to be honest with you about your project, I also recognize the challenges that come with engaging in the creative process. <br> <br> Creativity is <b>vulnerable</b> and <b>difficult</b>. <br> <br> And because I understand this on a personal level, I will always approach your project with empathy, kindness, and a shared commitment to helping you further your journey.</p>

            <p>I'm an avid gamer with strong opinions and a deep desire to help others. In my own journey as a designer, I've spent more time than I'd care to admit nose-deep in rulebooks and participating in playtests with a wide range of communities. <br> <br> Using my experience, a sharp eye for detail, and insatiable curiosity, I will explore the ins and outs of your game with the goal of empowering you with the new perspective necessary to take it to the next level. <br> <br>
                
                Something I try to remember: Design is art. We are artists. <br> <br> That's a tiny bit scary but also <i> so incredibly exciting!</i> </p>
