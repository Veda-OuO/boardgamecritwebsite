                    <p>"I think Greg is my new favorite person. Just days after reaching out to him, he sent me a video of a full blind playtest session with my game. He was patient, attentive, insightful, and encouraging. I really can't thank him enough and would encourage any aspiring designer to take advantage of this opportunity!."</p>

                    <p>"Is it possible you are the best playtester in human history? Many are saying it, and I refuse to argue with them. Thanks, seriously."</p>

                    <p>"Just wanted everyone to know Greg does excellent work. High quality video with precise and honest feedback should help me improve. He was very friendly when explaining TTS items I could have optimized, which I was very worried about beforehand. Thanks Greg"</p>

                    <p>"Many playtesters tend to be either too negative, which can feel discouraging, or too kind, offering mostly positive impressions that make it harder to identify what needs improvement. You managed to be both encouraging and constructively critical."</p>

                <div class="testimonial-card">
                    <p>"For an indie designer like me, this kind of in-depth, constructive feedback is pure gold. It's not just a list of problems, but a clear analysis that provides motivation and a real direction for improvement. It's clear that he does this out of a genuine passion for helping the design community."</p>

                    <h3>Uncover The Experience</h3>
                    <p>My primary role as a playtester is to uncover the unique experience your game offers to its players. <br> <br> Does it deliver on the vision you have in mind as the designer?<br><br>What already succeeds and is fun? What could be improved?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Find What Is True</h3>
                    <p>It is my belief that there are truths within the creative world: some games just are more fun than others.<br> <br> Players can feel when a game needed more time in the tank.<br> <br> My ambition is to help you discover these truths within your own project so that your next step can be taken with confidence and purpose.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Art = Hard</h3>
                    <p>While my first duty is to be honest with you about your project, I also recognize the challenges that come with engaging in the creative process. <br> <br> Creativity is <b>vulnerable</b> and <b>difficult</b>. <br> <br> And because I understand this on a personal level, I will always approach your project with empathy, kindness, and a shared commitment to helping you further your journey.</p>

        <div class="about-text">
            <p>I'm an avid gamer with strong opinions and a deep desire to help others. In my own journey as a designer, I've spent more time than I'd care to admit nose-deep in rulebooks and participating in playtests with a wide range of communities. <br> <br> I bring experience, a sharp eye for detail, and an insatiable curiosity that won’t stop asking the hard questions at the heart of what makes your game truly engaging. <br> <br>
                
                Something I try to remember: Design is art. We are artists. <br> <br> That's a tiny bit scary but also <i> so incredibly exciting!</i> </p>
