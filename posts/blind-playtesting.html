                <h1>The Importance of Blind Playtesting</h1>
                <p class="post-meta">Posted on October 14, 2025</p>
                 <p>There are a number of milestones that punctuate the road to designing a fun game, and, apart from publication itself, none is more important and revealing than the blind playtest.</p>

  <p>However, in your game’s early development, there should be nothing blind about the playtests you conduct. As a designer with a budding project, you will need to be present with the testers in order to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Make on-the-fly rules adjustments </li>
    <p> </p>
    <li>Clarify nuances that were perhaps omitted in your teach</li>
      <p> </p>
    <li>Re-balance synergies or effects that are too strong or too weak to be interesting</li>
      <p> </p>
    <li>And you may even need to explain the <i>fun of the game</i> , as you see it, so that your testers can try to tap into the same vision you hold in your head</li>
    <p> </p>
</ul>

  <p>However, over time, and as you receive and parse feedback, your game will slowly grow to the point where it will have the strength to stand on its own legs. This is the hallmark of a blind playtest, and its primary source of power: the sudden and complete absence of designer influence in the playtesting process.</p>

  <p><strong>What a scary moment!</strong></p>

  <p>And, in coming to terms with this vulnerable process of freeing our creative project, we have to remind ourselves it is an absolutely essential separation to make. The extent of our own influence cannot be overstated. Even if we resolve ourselves to saying nothing, simply sharing the room with playtesters is enough to distort the true play experience of your game into something unrecognizable from what is actually held within the pages of your rulebook.</p>

  <p>And that is the antithesis of what blind playtesting is all about. Rather, blind playtesting is the true measure of the parts of your project that are <i>actually in the world</i>, and <strong>not</strong> of what is <i>in your head</i>.</p>

  <h3>So, how do you know when your game is ready for blind playtesting?</h3>

  <p>You can never be absolutely certain. The best that can be done is to monitor your supervised teaches and playtests for naturally-occurring playtester independence.</p>

  <p>Things to look for include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How many times do players appeal to you for rules clarifications after playing the first round? Once per turn is clearly too much. A few times a round would also be a little disquieting—especially if no new systems have been introduced.<br><br>
    For a rough estimation, if your playtesters are attentive, there should be fewer than one serious rules question per round.</li>
<p> </p>
    <li>Are players able to “sink” into the game enough to formulate long-term strategies? A better way to say this is, “Are players able to manifest desires about what they want to accomplish within the game?” This might be the most important piece of the puzzle—it signals everything from balance, clarity, and coherence, all the way up to the idea of having fun within the established rules of your game.</li>
<p> </p>
    <li>Are players paying attention to their respective positions in the game? Do they actually care about who is winning?</li>
<p> </p>
    <li>When players look up rules in the rulebook, do they come away with quick and clean answers?</li>
<p> </p>
    <li>Lastly, are players giving you meaningful feedback? Are they asking questions that interrogate the fun and less fun parts of the game?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Games that are not quite ready tend to elicit questions that come from a place of distance. The question doesn't stem from <i>what it's like</i> to play your game. For example, playtesters might ask what certain icons mean, or what their options were to achieve a given goal within the game. These are important to answer, but they don't poke at the heart of what makes your game fun.</p>

  <p>If your sessions exhibit most of these criteria, I would say that it’s time to take the leap.</p>

  <p>Your first blind playtest might fizzle—maybe even in the first round. In fact, I have tested many games where I could not complete a single turn. And you know what? <i>That’s totally fine.</i></p>

  <p>Art is <i>hard.</i> Creativity is a <i>process.</i> Your dream is novel. No one has done this exact thing before.</p>

  <p>Always remember that a failed playtest does not mean your project is doomed. Dead dreams are only those that are not offered to the world beyond ourselves. Keep sharing and keep asking.</p>

  <p>Playtests, and blind playtests in particular, consistently point you in the direction of easy-to-apprehend and clear-to-understand, substantive improvements--they find the low hanging fruit capable of catapulting your game to the next level.</p>

  <p>There is no greater gift an artist can receive. <br><br>Every missed playtest is a missed opportunity to make your game more fun!</p>
