                    <p>"I think Greg is my new favorite person. Just days after reaching out to him, he sent me a video of a full blind playtest session with my game. He was patient, attentive, insightful, and encouraging. I really can't thank him enough and would encourage any aspiring designer to take advantage of this opportunity!."</p>

                    <p>"Is it possible you are the best playtester in human history? Many are saying it, and I refuse to argue with them. Thanks, seriously."</p>

                    <p>"Just wanted everyone to know Greg does excellent work. High quality video with precise and honest feedback should help me improve. He was very friendly when explaining TTS items I could have optimized, which I was very worried about beforehand. Thanks Greg"</p>

                    <p>"Many playtesters tend to be either too negative, which can feel discouraging, or too kind, offering mostly positive impressions that make it harder to identify what needs improvement. You managed to be both encouraging and constructively critical."</p>

                <div class="review-card">
                    <p>"For an indie designer like me, this kind of in-depth, constructive feedback is pure gold. It's not just a list of problems, but a clear analysis that provides motivation and a real direction for improvement. It's clear that he does this out of a genuine passion for helping the design community."</p>
